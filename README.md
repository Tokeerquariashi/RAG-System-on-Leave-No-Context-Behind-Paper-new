# RAG-System-on-Leave-No-Context-Behind-Paper-new
Overview:
As language models like Gemini evolve, the challenge remains in integrating them with the latest, domain-specific information often siloed in formats like PDFs and text files. We're tackling this head-on by leveraging the LangChain framework to create a robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. Our aim is to enrich the Gemini 1.5 Pro model with targeted information to enhance its applicability and accuracy.

Project Details:
Using the recently published "Leave No Context Behind" paper by Google (April 10th, 2024), our RAG system will retrieve external data to provide contextually rich, accurate answers to complex queries. This integration will bridge the gap between static knowledge and real-time data needs, ensuring our LLM can perform at its peak with the most up-to-date information.

Why It's Important:
This project not only advances our understanding of how to effectively utilize LLMs like Gemini but also sets the stage for future applications where real-time data integration is crucial for delivering precise and relevant responses.
